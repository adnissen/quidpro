It's not SaaS, it's software you can use however you want. The interface is dead simple. The code is tiny and easy to modify. It's perfect to host on a local network or on a vps with your friends. Use it as a way to transfer documents from home to work, or anything else. It's basically ftp except with less features and a nice web interface.\r\n\r\n### How do I get started?\r\n\r\nFirst, git checkout this repo or download the zip. Assuming you have node installed, run \"npm install\", followed by \"node app\". It's now running on port 3000.","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
